# Final Project (OCN-682) 
This is a repository for my Data Fundamentals in R class at University of Hawaii. For this project I used the Mo'orea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) public data repository. To analyze and vizualize the data I made a [Shiny app]( https://annie-deck.shinyapps.io/Final_project_shiny/). 

## Research Questions
1) How has benthic cover of hard coral and turf algae changed over the last two decades in Mo'orea?
2) How has the change in benthos as a result of the crown of thorns outbreak (2007-2012) and cyclone (2010) impacted fish abundance?

## Contents
* Output #1: Map of Mo'orea and the 6 LTER sampling sites
* Ouput #2: Barplot of % cover by site and habitat (2005-2023)
* Ouput #3: Lineplot of % cover of hard coral vs turf algae by site and habitat (2005-2023)
* Output #4: Lollipop plot of change in average abundance of various fish functional groups (2007-2012), LTER site 1 outer reef (10m)
