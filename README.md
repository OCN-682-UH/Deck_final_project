# Final Project (OCRN-682) 
This is a repository for my Data Fundamentals in R class at University of Hawaii. For this project I used data from the Mo'orea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) public data repository. 

## Research Questions
1) How has benthic cover of hard coral and turf algae changed over the last two decades in Mo'orea?
2) How has the change in benthos as a result of the crown of thorns outbreak (2007-2012) and cyclone (2010) impacted fish abundance?
